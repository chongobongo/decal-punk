Here's how to push to a GitHub repository:
First-time setup (if you haven't already):

Clone the repo (if you don't have it locally yet):

   git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
Then navigate into it: cd repository-name
The basic push workflow:

Stage your changes:

   git add .
(The . adds all changed files, or replace it with a specific filename)

Commit your changes:

   git commit -m "Your commit message here"

Push to GitHub:

   git push origin main
Replace main with your branch name if it's different (e.g., master or a feature branch).

If it's a brand new local repo you want to push for the first time:
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
git push -u origin main

Common issues:

Authentication: GitHub no longer accepts passwords — you'll need a personal access token or SSH key.
Behind the remote: If your push is rejected, run git pull origin main first to sync, then push again.
Wrong branch: Use git branch to see which branch you're on.
